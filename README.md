# Bluetooth Operated Pick & Place Robot

This is a **Bluetooth-controlled Pick and Place Robot** I built during my engineering.  
It combines **mechanical design, electronics, and programming** to create a real-world working prototype.

## Features
- 4-wheel mobile base with DC motors  
- Robotic arm with **3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**  
- Gripper operated using worm gear  
- Wireless control via **Bluetooth (HC-05 module)**  
- 8051 microcontroller with embedded C programming  
- Mechanical design in **CATIA**  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** 8051 MCU, L293D motor driver, DC motors, HC-05 Bluetooth  
- **Software:** CATIA, Keil ÂµVision  
- **Programming:** Embedded C

## Results
- Successfully lifted up to **250 grams**  
- Torque range: **392.4 â€“ 981 N-mm**  
- Fully functional prototype tested successfully

## How It Works
1. Mobile app sends commands to the HC-05 Bluetooth module.  
2. 8051 Microcontroller interprets signals.  
3. L293D driver controls DC motors.  
4. Base moves, arm rotates, and gripper opens/closes to pick/place objects.
